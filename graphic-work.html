      <p>A Garamond logotype postcard design based on the history of the typeface.</p>
      <p>Garamond was created by Claude Garamond, a sixteenth century Renaissance artist. It was originally intended for use at French Court during the rule of Francis I. This was the first punch-cut type face of it’s time to deviate from more handwritten styles. Its delicate lines were also considered more eco friendly as well because less ink was used during print. The modern typesets that carry Garamond’s namesake are heavily inspired by the artist’s original design. Today, Garamond is still considered the standard for serif typefaces and is famously used within the Google logo and Dr. Seuss children books.</p>
