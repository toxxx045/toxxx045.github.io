         <p>Hello! My name is Vivian To, and I am an aspiring prodcut designer. Although I am currently studing product design at the University of Minnesota, I also enjoy dabbling in many other forms of design, including graphic and web design. Before I discovered design, however; my main interests were in biology and the fine arts. I spent most of my days switching between painting in studio and running experiments in a laboratory. The logics of science and the freedom to create in art were two things I wanted to combine in a way that could benefit others. I found that balance in product design after learning about the profession from a stranger on a bus ride to class one day. I now have a bachelors in biolgy and use what I've learned to inspire the function and form of my desgins. Outside of my studies, I also love playing badminton (real competetive badminton on an indoor court), reading, and discovering new cafes.</p>
